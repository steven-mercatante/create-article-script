# Create Article script

This is a bash script that uses [Gatsby Post Manager](https://github.com/steven-mercatante/gatsby-post-manager) to create articles for [https://stevenmercatante.com](https://stevenmercatante.com)

The script is specifically tailored to _my_ use, but it's well commented and can easily be changed to work for _your_ site.
